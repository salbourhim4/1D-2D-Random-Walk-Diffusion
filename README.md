# 1D-2D Random Walk Diffusion Simulation
## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulations of unbiased random walks to demonstrate diffusion by computing the mean squared displacement (MSD) and extracting the diffusion coefficient. The simulations verify theoretical scaling laws numerically, showing that MSD ∝ t for both 1D and 2D random walks
## Key Results
* Demonstrates that mean squared displacement scales linearly with time
* Extracts diffusion coefficients from simulated data
* Shows convergence to theoretical predictions as the number of walks increases
* Validates Einsteins relation for Brownian motion
