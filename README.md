# 1D-2D Random Walk Diffusion Simulation
## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulations of unbiased random walks to demonstrate diffusion by computing the mean squared displacement (MSD) and extracting the diffusion coefficient. The simulations verify theoretical scaling laws numerically, showing that MSD ∝ t for both 1D and 2D random walks
